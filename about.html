        <p>Since our founding in 1976, we have had activism in our DNA. We create campaigns and support causes that are true to our 
          founder, Anita Roddick's conviction that a business can be a force for good. We take on the mission of 
          enriching our products, people and planet, helping communities to prosper, with our Commerce with Communities  program, 
          in addition to being forever against animal testing.</p>
          <p>THE BODY SHOP'S FIRST STORE 
            The Body Shop's first store opened on March 26, 1976, in Brighton, on the south coast of England. In 1978, the company 
            expanded to Brussels, Belgium, through a kiosk, which represented its entry into the franchise business. From 1982 onwards, 
            new stores began to open around the world.</p>
